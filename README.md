# ob-bigquery
Emacs org babel support for bigquery

This module is heavily based on the ob-sqlite code that is shipped as part of the standard org distribution. The existing functionality is pretty barebones but it should be fully functional with the latest version of the `bq` cli utility that is shipped as part of the Google Cloud SDK.
